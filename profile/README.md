# CCleaner 
CCleaner Professional (often referred to as CCleaner Pro) is the paid version of the popular PC optimization and cleaning tool, CCleaner. While the free version provides basic cleaning and privacy features, the professional version includes a suite of advanced features designed to automatically maintain and improve PC performance.

## Key Features:

1. PC Health Check: This is a comprehensive tool that analyzes your computer and provides recommendations for improving its health. It identifies issues and offers one-click fixes.

2. Performance Optimizer: This feature is designed to speed up your PC by putting unnecessary programs that run in the background to "sleep" when you're not using them. It can help free up system resources and improve boot times.

3. Driver Updater: It scans your system for outdated, missing, or broken drivers and helps you update them to the latest versions. Keeping drivers up-to-date can improve hardware performance, reduce crashes, and fix bugs.

4. Software Updater: This feature automatically checks for and updates outdated applications, which helps to reduce security vulnerabilities.

5. Real-time Monitoring & Smart Cleaning: CCleaner Pro can monitor your system in the background and automatically clean up junk files as they accumulate. It can be set to notify you when a certain threshold of junk files is reached.

6. Privacy Protection: It goes beyond the free version by automatically clearing your Browse history, cookies, and other tracking files from all major browsers to help keep your online activity private.

7. Cloud Drive Cleaner: A newer feature that scans and analyzes your cloud storage accounts (like Google Drive) to find duplicate, large, and old files, helping you free up space.
## CCleaner Pro vs. Free Version:

The core difference lies in automation and advanced tools. The free version provides manual cleaning, while the Pro version automates many of these tasks. For example, with the free version, you have to manually run the cleaner, but with Pro, you get real-time monitoring and scheduled cleanups. The Pro version also includes the Driver Updater and Performance Optimizer, which are not available in the free version.

## System Requirements:

CCleaner has relatively low system requirements and is compatible with a wide range of Windows and macOS systems. The specific requirements can vary, but generally, it works on modern versions of Windows (Windows 11, 10, 8.1, 7) and requires a minimal amount of RAM and disk space for installation.
